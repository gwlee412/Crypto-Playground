## About the Project
Based off of real time crytpo data, this is an ongoing collaborative project. The goal is to implement an app through which users can experiment with fake crytpo money and real crypto data to discuss with other users to get a feel of how crypto works. It is targeted to users who wish to know more about crytpo investing and trading in a risk- free safe environment. Currently, the features of the app include
* An anonymous real time chat function for users to interact using socket.io and express. ## Note: In the chat-server directory, must run the COMMAND NPM start for the server to work.
